        My name is Kasey Campbell, and I enjoy drinking wine, reading, and listening to vinyl records with my cats, Walter and Billie Jean, at home in Daleville, VA.
      </p>
      <p>
        I began my coding journey in the midst of COVID when I, like many others, found my life more unpredictable than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        My career path has been varied - from social researcher to museum coordinator, from medical biller to administrative assistant, I have found myself wearing many hats and amassing a great amount of transferable skills.
        <li>
          <ul>My interpersonal skills, honed from years of customer service and mentorship, make me effective as a team member, a leader, and an individual.</ul>
          <ul>My technical skills include self-taught comprehension of job-specific computer software, extensive work within databases and spreadsheets, and technical writing including instruction guides and grant applications.</ul>
          <ul>My other soft skills, such as excellent communication, multitasking, time management, and creativity, are also great assets.</ul>
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        As a developer, I wish to prove myself invaluable in the field before pursuing a career in furthering the education of others.
